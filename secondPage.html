          <p>My fascination with the <span>musical and spiritual history</span> that lies within the streets of New Orleans led it to top my travel bucket list. I fell in love with jazz in college. It helped me focus and study for long periods of time as the melodies seemed to mimic the rhythm of my favorite place -- the ocean. It's funny that I was not exposed to the spiritual aspect until I encountered season 3 of American Horror Story. It sparked my interest in African and Creole spirituality. </p>

          <p>All of us must visit the <span>birthplace of human civilization</span>. My son is named after this place. I hope to take him there one day, so he can understand why I chose such a powerful name for him. The level of mental control and education is displayed in Egypt is not seen anywhere else. They built enormous pyramids that scientist to this day cannot seem to explain. The languages and hieroglyphics are extremely fascinating. I studies Anthropology in college, so artifacts and historical data is a strong interest.</p>
